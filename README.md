## Installation

At least for now I don't want to unnecessarily pollute Package Control. So installation is manual:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bevesce/SublimeLogtime.git Logtime
mv Logtime "path/to/Sublime Text 3/Packages/"
```

There's one git submodule here so you need to use `--recursive` flag.

## Features
### Syntax highlighting

Highlighting should work with every color scheme:

### Filter & sum

You can filter (by folding) log items with *logtime* queries:

![filter](screenshots/filter.gif)

Pressing enter will show quick panel with the total amount of time spent on resulting log items.
